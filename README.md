## Project Overview
In this analysis, we were asked to pull data for employees for a fictional company.  We used SQL queries to identify from the existing tables employees who were retiring soon and eligible for a Mentorship program.

There are qualified employees that are available to mentor the next generation of employees, although new employees will be needed to filled the positions to make up the difference.  There are less Senior Engineers eligible for the mentorship program, so special attention may be needed to recruit them at a higher rate.
